# Kubernetes CI (KCI)

KCI is a simple build tool that allows you to run builds in your Kubernetes
cluster using a simple build file format

This is an example build file

```yaml
repository: https://github.com/patnaikshekhar/KubernetesCIToolExample
steps:
- image: golang:1.13.0-alpine3.10
  args: ["go", "test"]
- image: golang:1.13.0-alpine3.10
  args: ["go", "build", "-o", "app"]
```

The build file consists of a series of steps to execute sequentially. Each step
consists of an image and a list of args. In the above example, code is
downloaded from the repository mentioned in the repository param. The golang
image is downloaded and then go test is executed. Then in step 2 again the
golang image is used and go build is executed. 

## Usage

KCI can be installed in your organization by running

```sh

git clone https://github.com/patnaikshekhar/KubernetesCITool

kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

You then need to download the CLI from ???

The CLI needs to be configured with the following commands

```sh
KCI_IP=$(kubectl get svc kci-server -n kci -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")

./kci config url KCI_IP:10000
```

Now you can run a build by running

```sh
./kci build ./examples/simple.yaml
```
